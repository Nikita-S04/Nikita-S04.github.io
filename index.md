### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs that we did. It was very special to me as this was my first time coding and putting out my work to the world of programming. I learned how to navigate github and add, commit, push. I learned how to print the text to the terminal using the std::cout function. 

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 2 was another one of my favorite lab that we did this semester. it was the one where we built a function for the game, blackjack. The terminal prints "bust" if your score for the game goes over 21. Inorder to win, you have to score more points than the computer while not going over 21. It was where we learned how to do complex loops and it was my first time using if, else statements. It helped me realize how important loops and if statements are in the world of coding. 

* Lab 10
    Lab 10, part 2 was also another one of the labs I enjoyed doing. It was the one where it took command line arguments from the user and it searched 2d vector for the user input. With the user input, we were able to find the counties in California and its population from the 2d vectors. I like this lab because it helped me learn how to iterate through 2d vectors.
